# Sorting-level-1 (PLC)
This project contains the Sorting Level 1 program I developed as part of my PLC training using Siemens TIA portal and Factory IO. It demonstrates a basic automated sorting process with save state, using ladder logic to control sensors and actuators for separating items based on its size.
